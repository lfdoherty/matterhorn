'Matterhorn' is a means for composing web application modules built using node.js and the express framework, and a collection of such modules.

Right now, this software is undocumented and largely untested.  You'd be crazy to use it.

Matterhorn is intended to be a solution to the problem of composing together the many disparate elements that make up a node.js web app: CSS, Javascript, templates, etc.  It has fairly specific ideas about how a web application should be built.
